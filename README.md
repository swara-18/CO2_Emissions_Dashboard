# Global_CO2_Emissions_Dashboard(Interactive Dashboard Creation using Tableau)
I developed a comprehensive project in Tableau, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This project involved several stages including data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualisation.

## Project_Objective
1. profile and QA the data
2. Prepare and Transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that the public can use to identify patterns, trends, and drivers of global CO2 emissions.
3. Visualise the data and summarise findings.

## Dataset
-<a href="https://github.com/swara-18/CO2_Emissions_Dashboard/blob/main/visualizing_global_co2_data.csv"> Global CO2 Emission Dataset</a>

## Questions
# Objective 1
1. Connect to the dataset(Extract the data). Take a moment to familiarize with the data. Which countries are the largest contributors of CO2?
2. Add a data source filter to exclude NULL ISO codes.
3. Create a new integer type parameter named TopN with a default value of 10.
   
# Objective 2

1. Create a sheet with a line chart showing the % of total share of CO2 by year for the top 10 countries using your TOP N parameter (remove any null value countries)
2. Create a sheet with a map at country level using Co2 Per Capita for the year 2021 only (fix any country/region errors, remove null value countries)
3. Create a sheet with a scatter plot comparing Co2 and population at country level, with bubbles sized by Temperature Change From Co2 for the year 2021 (BONUS: Add a linear regression trend line)
4. Color all 3 visualizations using Co2 per capita and apply a divergent color scale.

# Objective 3

1. Add sheets to your dashboard to show % of Co2 trend as a line chart, Co2 per capita a map, and the relationships between Co2 and population as a scatter plot.
2. Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout and include a title and TOP N parameter at the top of your dashboard.
3. Add a filter for the country.
4. Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard.
5. Do you notice any interesting patterns or trends? What insights do you find when looking at the global Co2 impact and trends?
